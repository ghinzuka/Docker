# Docker Overview

Docker is a platform that allows you to develop, deploy, and run applications inside containers. Containers are lightweight and portable units of software that package up code and all its dependencies, enabling applications to run quickly and reliably across different computing environments.

## Key Concepts

### Images

An image is a read-only template with instructions for creating a Docker container. It includes everything needed to run an application - code, runtime, libraries, and dependencies.

### Containers

A container is a runnable instance of an image. It encapsulates the application and its dependencies, ensuring consistency and isolation. Containers are isolated from each other and from the underlying host system.

### Dockerfile

A Dockerfile is a text document that contains instructions to build a Docker image. It specifies the base image, environment variables, commands to run during build time, and more.

### Docker Hub

Docker Hub is a cloud-based repository where Docker images can be stored, shared, and accessed. It hosts thousands of pre-built images for various applications and environments.

## Benefits

- **Portability:** Docker containers can run consistently on any infrastructure that supports Docker.
  
- **Isolation:** Applications and their dependencies are isolated within containers, reducing conflicts and ensuring reproducibility.
  
- **Efficiency:** Containers are lightweight and share the host system's kernel, making them faster to start and use fewer resources than traditional virtual machines.

## Getting Started

To start using Docker:
1. **Install Docker:** Visit [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/get-started) to download and install Docker for your operating system.
   
2. **Pull an Image:** Use `docker pull` to fetch an image from Docker Hub.
   ```bash
   docker pull nginx
    ```
3. **Run a Container: Use docker run to start a container from an image.
   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 8080:80 nginx
   ```
